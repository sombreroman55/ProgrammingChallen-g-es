# Challenge 097 - Generate a 5-color scheme from the most dominant tones in any image

I did this as part of my [palette-helper](https://github.com/sombreroman55/palette-helper) project.
See that repo for an example. In fact, you can generate a palette size up to 36 colors and also
control how far apart the "dominant" tones must be so that one color family doesn't dominate the
palette.
