# Challenge 016

This is a text editor written in Perl with the `curses` Perl bindings as an exercise to learn the
Perl programming language. It supports only the most basic features a text editor would be expected
to support. Perhaps I'll add more later, but I probably won't, as I will use what I learn here to
create a more fully-featured text editor as part of a larger project I have planned.
