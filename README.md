# Programming Challen/g/es

This is a repository to house my attempts at /g/'s Programming Challenges image.
As the image rightly says, I have not been "afraid to write awful code", but I
hope that my efforts will show some improvement as I continue to work toward my
goal of completing all of these challenges.

I will keep this README and repository up to date with the status of which
challenges I'm working on and which ones I've finished. If you notice anything
wrong with my code, feel free to let me know, or fix it and send me a pull
request.
